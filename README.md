# 🖥️ VNC Server  

**VNC (Virtual Network Computing)** is a remote desktop-sharing protocol that allows users to control another computer over a network.  
It works by transmitting keyboard/mouse inputs and screen updates between the **client** and **server**.

## ❓ What is VNC?  
VNC enables remote control of a computer by sharing its graphical screen output and capturing input from the remote user.  
It is commonly used in IT support, system administration, and cybersecurity.

## 🔐 Use Cases of VNC in Cybersecurity  
- 🛠 **Remote Administration** – IT admins use VNC to manage servers and workstations remotely.  
- ⚔️ **Penetration Testing** – Ethical hackers exploit misconfigured VNC setups to gain remote access.  
- 🚨 **Incident Response** – Security teams use VNC to analyze and mitigate security incidents remotely.  
- 🕵️ **Forensic Investigations** – VNC helps security teams access compromised machines for investigation.  
- 🎭 **Social Engineering & Phishing** – Attackers may trick users into installing VNC-based backdoors.

## ❌ Cons of VNC in Cybersecurity  

❌ **Weak Security** – Some implementations use little or no encryption.  

❌ **Brute-Force Attacks** – Weak passwords can be easily cracked.  

❌ **Network Latency** – Slower compared to RDP due to high bandwidth usage.  

❌ **Unauthenticated Access Risks** – Many organizations expose VNC directly to the internet.  

❌ **Lack of Logging & Monitoring** – Makes forensic investigations difficult.

# 🖥️ VNC Server  

**VNC (Virtual Network Computing)** is a remote desktop-sharing protocol that allows users to control another computer over a network.  
It works by transmitting keyboard/mouse inputs and screen updates between the **client** and **server**.

## ❓ What is VNC?  
VNC enables remote control of a computer by sharing its graphical screen output and capturing input from the remote user.  
It is commonly used in IT support, system administration, and cybersecurity.

## 🔐 Use Cases of VNC in Cybersecurity  
- 🛠 **Remote Administration** – IT admins use VNC to manage servers and workstations remotely.  
- ⚔️ **Penetration Testing** – Ethical hackers exploit misconfigured VNC setups to gain remote access.  
- 🚨 **Incident Response** – Security teams use VNC to analyze and mitigate security incidents remotely.  
- 🕵️ **Forensic Investigations** – VNC helps security teams access compromised machines for investigation.  
- 🎭 **Social Engineering & Phishing** – Attackers may trick users into installing VNC-based backdoors.

## ✅ Pros of VNC in Cybersecurity  
- ✅ **Easy Remote Access** – Manage devices from anywhere.  
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Support** – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
- ✅ **Open-Source Options** – Tools like TightVNC, UltraVNC, and TigerVNC provide free solutions.  
- ✅ **Graphical Interface** – Unlike SSH, VNC provides a full GUI experience.  
- ✅ **Screen Sharing** – Useful for monitoring user activity.

## ❌ Cons of VNC in Cybersecurity  
- ❌ **Weak Security** – Some implementations use little or no encryption.  
- ❌ **Brute-Force Attacks** – Weak passwords can be easily cracked.  
- ❌ **Network Latency** – Slower compared to RDP due to high bandwidth usage.  
- ❌ **Unauthenticated Access Risks** – Many organizations expose VNC directly to the internet.  
- ❌ **Lack of Logging & Monitoring** – Makes forensic investigations difficult.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Best Practices for VNC  
- 🔒 **Use Strong Authentication** – Always enable strong passwords and MFA.  
- 🌐 **Never Expose VNC Directly to the Internet** – Use a VPN or SSH tunnel.  
- 🛡️ **Enable Encryption** – Configure VNC with TLS/SSL.  
- 🛠 **Restrict IP Access** – Use firewall rules to allow only trusted IPs.  
- 🔄 **Monitor & Log Sessions** – Keep detailed logs for audits and investigations.

## 📚 Libraries Used in a VNC Server Implementation  

1️⃣ **struct (Binary Data Handling)**  
   - Used for packing and unpacking binary data.  
   - Essential for transmitting raw data between server and client.  
   - Example: handling screen frames in a VNC client/server setup.  

2️⃣ **cv2 (OpenCV – Image Processing)**  
   - Handles image and video processing.  
   - Captures the screen, processes frames, and displays them on the client side.  

3️⃣ **numpy (Numerical Computation)**  
   - Represents image data as arrays.  
   - Works seamlessly with OpenCV for frame operations.  

4️⃣ **socket (Network Communication)**  
   - Establishes server-client connections.  
   - Sends and receives image frames, keyboard, and mouse inputs over the network.  

5️⃣ **pyautogui (Automation – Mouse & Keyboard Control)**  
   - Automates mouse and keyboard actions.  
   - Used to apply remote commands received from the VNC client.

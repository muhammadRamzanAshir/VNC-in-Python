# VNC Server
VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop-sharing protocol that allows users to control another computer over a network. It works by transmitting the keyboard, mouse inputs, and screen updates between the client and server.
# What is VNC?
VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a remote desktop-sharing protocol that allows users to control another computer over a network. It works by transmitting the keyboard, mouse inputs, and screen updates between the client and server.
# Use Cases of VNC in Cybersecurity
    Remote Administration – IT admins use VNC to manage servers and workstations remotely.
    Penetration Testing – Ethical hackers exploit misconfigured VNC setups to gain remote access.
    Incident Response – Security teams use VNC to analyze and mitigate security incidents remotely.
    Forensic Investigations – VNC helps security teams access compromised machines for investigation.
    Social Engineering & Phishing – Attackers can trick users into installing VNC-based backdoors.
# Pros of VNC in Cybersecurity
✅ Easy Remote Access – Allows managing devices from anywhere.
✅ Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
✅ Open-Source Options – TightVNC, UltraVNC, and TigerVNC provide free solutions.
✅ Graphical Interface – Unlike SSH or RDP, VNC provides a full GUI experience.
✅ Screen Sharing – Helps in monitoring user activity.
# Cons of VNC in Cybersecurity
❌ Weak Security – Uses weak encryption (or none at all in some implementations).
❌ Brute-Force Attacks – Attackers can easily crack VNC passwords if not properly secured.
❌ Network Latency – Slower compared to RDP due to high bandwidth usage.
❌ Unauthenticated Access Risks – Many organizations expose VNC on the internet without strong authentication, making it a prime target for attackers.
❌ Lack of Logging & Monitoring – Unlike RDP, VNC does not provide detailed session logs, making forensic investigations difficult.
# Cybersecurity Best Practices for VNC
🔒 Use Strong Authentication – Always enable passwords and multi-factor authentication.
🌐 Never Expose VNC to the Internet – Use a VPN or SSH tunnel instead.
🛡️ Enable Encryption – Configure VNC with TLS/SSL encryption.
🛠 Restrict IP Access – Use firewall rules to allow only trusted IPs.
🔄 Monitor & Log Sessions – Keep track of VNC connections for security audits.
# Lib Infromation Server  
1️⃣ struct (Binary data handling):
    1️⃣ the struct module is used for packing and unpacking  binary data.
    2️⃣ this is useful when sending and receiving raw data over network.
        e.g., in vnc server-client setup.
2️⃣ CV2 (openCv-image processing):
    1️⃣ openCv is used for handling images and videos.
    2️⃣ in a vnc client/server, it helps capture the screen, process the frame and display them.
3️⃣ numpy (Numarical Computation):
    1️⃣ numpy is used to handle the image data as array.
    2️⃣ OpenCv works with numpy arrays for images operations.
4️⃣ socket (Network Communication):
    1️⃣ used to create server client connection for remote control.
    2️⃣ send and recive the image frames, keyboared and mouse inputs over the network
5️⃣ pyautogui (Automating mouse and keyboared):
    1️⃣ used to remotly control the mouse and keyboared.
    2️⃣ help n sending the commands.
